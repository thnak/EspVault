# This directory contains SSL/TLS certificates for secure MQTT communication
# 
# Files to add:
# - ca_cert.pem: CA certificate for broker verification
# - client_cert.pem: Client certificate (if using mutual TLS)
# - client_key.pem: Client private key (if using mutual TLS)
#
# These certificates will be embedded in the firmware or stored in encrypted NVS
